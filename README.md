# Encryptor-V2 (py)
#A basic ASCII based encryptor. Currently can encrypt and decrypt plain text with a randomized key (from py random.random()).
--> to be added : secure method of transferrring key. 
--> to be added : encoding more complex encryption protocols into key with digit dependent activation.
--> Also it would be nice if someone knew what the name of this type of encryption is. I just came up with this idea some day and made this proof of concept. It would be nice to read some actual material on it :)
